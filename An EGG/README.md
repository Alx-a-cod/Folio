### 𓂃🥚 Pixel Timer ── .✦

A clean, minimalist desktop timer built with **Electron** and **Node.js**, and featuring **React + Vite** frontend.  
The app features four distinct retro interfaces inspired by a Figma design, each reflecting a different timer theme.  

**The goal**: to deliver a simple yet charming pixel-perfect timer that ensures your boiled eggs are always cooked just right.  
Because nobody deserves a rubbery disaster or a gooey surprise — may your eggs be eternally perfect, and your mornings never overcooked.  

###### And between us, it’s mostly me who’s been overcooking them. This app was way overdue.

#### 📍 Project Overview ── 

It began as a basic Electron + Node.js timer app, and is now being reworked to integrate a React + Vite frontend for better modularity, maintainability, and a smoother development experience.
The visual inspiration and UI flow are based on a personal Figma project that I am using as a creative and functional reference and that can be found here in the repo.

  
  
#### 📍 Interface Flow ── 

The application consists of **four main pixel-style interfaces**:

1. **Start Screen** — Clean and minimal, with a retro aesthetic.
2. **Timer Selection** — Allows the user to select from one of four themed timers.
3. **Active Timer** — Displays the countdown, styled per the selected theme.
4. **End Screen** — Offers an option to restart or snooze.

Each screen is being implemented with attention to pixel-level detail, following the Figma layout closely.
