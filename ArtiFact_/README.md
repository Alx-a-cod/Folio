### 𓂃🖌 Artifact ── .✦

Artifact is a Kotlin-based Android application developed as a collaborative two-person project for a Master's degree in Computer Science.  
The app leverages artificial intelligence and cloud services to deliver a camera-driven experience for the recognition, archival, and exploration of famous artworks.

#### 📍 Project Overview ── 

Artifact allows users to take photos of artworks using their mobile device. A trained AI model processes the image and retrieves detailed metadata such as the artwork’s _name_, _artist_, _period_, and _historical_ _context_ using the **Wikidata API**.  
Users can save, manage, and share their discoveries across a connected social layer.

#### 📍 Core Features

✧ **AI-Powered Artwork Recognition**  
  Users can take pictures of artworks. A custom-trained ML model powered by **ML Kit** classifies the image and retrieves semantic information using **Wikidata's REST** and **SPARQL APIs**.  

✧ **Multi-User System**  
  Users can register, log in, manage their profile, and connect with other users to view and share saved artworks.  

✧ **Favorites & Collections (CRUD)**  
    Each user can add, remove, and manage their favorite artworks. These collections are synced in the cloud and can be browsed by connected friends.  

✧ **Firebase Authentication**  
  The app uses Firebase Authentication for secure login and multi-user management.  

✧ **Firebase Integration**  
  Firebase handles real-time database sync, cloud storage, user management, and hosting of user-generated data.  

✧ **AI + External APIs**  
  Combines a custom-trained image classification model with real-time queries to the Wikidata API for rich historical and contextual information.  

✧ **Modern UI / UX**  
  The application features a responsive and intuitive UI, fully prototyped in Figma and implemented using **Jetpack Compose**.  

✧ **Concurrent Operations**  
  Image processing, API queries, and UI updates are managed asynchronously with **Kotlin coroutines** to ensure a responsive user experience.  

✧ **Sensor & Camera Usage**  
  Integrates Android’s camera framework (CameraX) and utilizes device sensors to improve the user experience when capturing images.  

✧ **Persistent Local + Cloud Storage**  
  User data and preferences are stored using Room for offline access and Firebase Cloud for real-time sync.

#### 📍 Architecture
  
The application follows the **MVVM architecture** with a clean separation of concerns.  
  
UI (Jetpack Compose)

#### 📍 Future Enhancements

✧ Add collaborative features: shared collections, comments  
✧ Recommendation engine for related artworks (?)  
✧ In-app chat or discussion around specific artworks (maybe? (ᵕ—ᴗ—))  
✧ Offline recognition via embedded model fallback  
✧ Power BI dashboard for visualizing user engagement (big stretch (·•᷄‎ࡇ•᷅ ). Still worth the try)
